### Hello there!

I'm Austin Hargis. I am a Computer Science student at Grand Valley State University. Currently, I am working on a number of projects in school and outside. My most notable project of late is [hammer](https://github.com/austinhargis/hammer), an inventory management system that I am working on with the help of a friend.
